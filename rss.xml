            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drink to Dublin: Jameson enlist artist James Earley to design new label.</h1><p>Any visitor to Dublin's fair city will quickly sense the iconic presence of Jameson whiskey, which is woven into the fabric of life in Ireland's capital. The brand began producing whiskey in Dublin in 1780, and has always been closely linked with the city's rich cultural scene, championing its music, literature, and art.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/16455e4742acf25a3370643f60034b3fa72e36d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Where to Eat Pizza: Phaidon presents the ultimate pizza bucket list | Lifestyle | Wallpaper* Magazine</h1><p>There are two kinds of books in this world: those everyone ought to read, and those that you must own.

Following on from 2015's great success Where Chefs Eat, Daniel Young's Where to Eat Pizza is an anthology of the best pizza places around the globe.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f7cb1d01b1f37c0fe4108294931866edcb74c23b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How to Build a Solid Drinking Library</h1><p>Are there places I like as much as great bars? Yes: great bookshops. And if I had to pick a favorite in the latter category, it's Dog Ears Book Barn in the little town of Hoosick, N.Y. Conveniently, it's just a little ways down Route 7 from the Man of Kent, one of America's best bars.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0273a33607950225cc804b6b0df8a694a29cdeef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>There's brew love in a new lager saga: Daniel Noah Sheikh reinvents beer.</h1><p>The crafting and consumption of artisanal ale has come to define hipsterdom as surely as unchecked facial hair and tattoos. Lager, once the fashionable brew, has been largely left out in the cold. One young MÃ¼nchner, though, is determined on rebuilding buzz around bold but bubbly Bavarian beer.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a1b9867e100274b4a255e35f15b19fc71dc32385.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Colorado's Woody Creek Distillers</h1><p>Only last week a panel of expert judges convened for the annual San Francisco World Spirits Competition-arguably the most prestigious and analytical booze assembling in the States. While the complete results won't be formally announced until 4 April, it's already known that Colorado's independently owned Woody Creek Distillers (located just a 20-minute drive from downtown Aspen) won double gold for one of their newer releases: a tasty small-batch Colorado Straight Rye.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b64dca9b02fd08fb329890c39fa2430abff82993.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Ars VR headset showdown-Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive</h1><p>In our original reviews of the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, we tried very hard to examine these virtual reality systems on their own merits without constant comparisons to the competition. But no product exists in a vacuum. After years of buildup, we're now faced with two competitive, PC-tethered VR headsets hitting the market right next to each other.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a473611978ca4931a0d74678d9cd4a6eaafdb8a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Photos of Various Food Dishes Flying Through the Air</h1><p>Camden, London-based commercial still life photographer Piotr Gregorczyk likes to play with food and gravity. One concept he has focused on for a number of recent projects is the idea of showing various food dishes flying through the air as they come together on a plate or in a bowl.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ea61b8e6e7eb14f53652b069cde3df0e37aa5826.jpg"></article>]]></description>
